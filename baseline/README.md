This folder contains code to run an implementation of our baseline Auto-Pipeline.


## Baseline: Auto-Pipeline*
To run this baseline, run runFoofah.py. This calls to_json.py to convert every table to the format needed by a modification of Explain-Da-V's implementation of Auto-pipeline (https://github.com/shraga89/ExplainDaV/tree/main). The set of tables given is the same set of candidate tables.
