# Benchmarks

This folder contains **TP-TR Med and Small benchmarks** that we use in our experiments. These two benchmarks are a variation of the [TPC-H benchmark](https://www.tpc.org/tpch/default5.asp): 
* TP-TR Med (TPC-H tables that are each 1/100 of its original table's rows)
    * datalake and queries are found in folder `tptr_med/` 
* TP-TR Small (TPC-H tables that are each 1/1000 of its original table's rows)
    * datalake and queries are found in folder `tptr_small/` 

Additionally, we use the SANTOS Large benchmark from [SANTOS](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3588689), T2D Gold benchmark, and a sample of WDC tables.
